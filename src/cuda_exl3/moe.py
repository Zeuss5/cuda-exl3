"""EXL3 mixture-of-experts method for vLLM.

Routed experts are executed as a grouped GEMM. vLLM's `moe_align_block_size`
sorts the (token, expert) pairs by expert and pads each expert's run out to a
whole block, so every row block belongs to exactly one expert -- which is what
lets the GEMM offset the trellis by a single expert id per block rather than per
row.

The EXL3 wrinkle is that `suh` is per expert *and* per shard, and it sits inside
the input Hadamard, so the activation transform has to happen after routing:
each routed row is transformed with its own expert's scales. That is what
`exl3_moe_had_in` does, gathering and transforming in one pass.
